        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            As a dedicated individual, I am driven by the desire to provide for my <br>
            family, which motivates me to work both honestly and diligently. I pride <br>
            myself on being friendly and helpful, always eager to acquire new skills <br>
            and gain valuable work experiences. My ability to work independently, as <br> 
            well as collaboratively within a team, highlights my versatility. I am a quick <br>
            learner who can adapt to various environments swiftly. <br><br>

            In addition, I have gained valuable retail experience working, full-time for <br>
            6 days at Mr. Price Home, where I developed strong customer service <br>
            skills and a solid understanding of retail operations. I am confident that <br>
            this experience has further enhanced my ability to engage with customers <br>
            and work effectively in a fast-paced environment. <br><br>

            I am a dedicated <b>Software Developer with experience</b> in <br>
            building websites, solving technical problems, and learning modern technologies. <br>
            I enjoy creating user-friendly digital solutions that help people and businesses. <br><br>

            I also hold a ,<strong>driver’s license (Code B)</strong> and have my own transport, <br>
            so travelling will not be an issue

        </p>

        <p>
            It all started in High School in my favourite class, Computer Application Technology, where my interest in coding began. <br>
            I started becoming more computer literate in Microsoft Word, Excel and started learning to code for the first time, which was HTML, <br>
            and while learning HTML, my interest grew and wanted to learn other programming languages. <br>
            I'm so fortunate to have been introduced to <a href="https://do4sa.org">Do4SA</a> where I can grow more <br>
            by furthering my studies in this career path that i've chosen.
